# Introduction

This repository contains a differentiable, 3D mesh renderer using PyTorch.

In an effort to learn both PyTorch and Tensorflow more I ported Google's
[tf_mesh_renderer](https://github.com/google/tf_mesh_renderer) from Tensorflow
to PyTorch.

The project is currently WIP. Forward pass is finished (though untested) and backwards
pass is yet to be implemented.
